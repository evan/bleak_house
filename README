BleakHouse

REQUIREMENTS

A *nix operating system. Windows is not supported.

Gems: 'gruff', 'rmagick', 'active_support', 'RubyInline'

You need to compile the bleak_house patched Ruby build. In the 
plugin directory: 
  rake ruby:build

USAGE

To profile your application:
  RAILS_ENV=production BLEAK_HOUSE=true ruby-bleak-house ./script/server 

Browse around manually, thrash your entire app with a script, 
target troublesome controllers/actions, etc.

Then, to analyze:
  RAILS_ENV=production SMOOTHNESS=1 rake bleak_house:analyze

And then look in log/bleak_house/.

TROUBLESHOOTING

If you see the error "Symbol not found: _rb_gc_heaps_used",
it means you installed the patched binary, but tried to profile the 
server with the regular binary.

You may get library require errors if you install ruby-bleak-house (1.8.6)
alongside a different verson of Ruby. You could try to patch your local
version of Ruby instead, or you could just upgrade to 1.8.6, which has
a good trackrecord of stability anyway.
